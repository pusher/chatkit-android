## [Unreleased](https://github.com/pusher/chatkit-android/compare/0.2.4...HEAD)

### Changed

- Renamed `onNewMessage` `RoomSubscriptionListeners` function to `onMessage` to make it clearer that it is the function that gets called when a new message is received over the room subscription, which includes historical messages upon initial subscription success
- Renamed the `NewMessage` `RoomSubscriptionEvent` to `Message`, for the same reasons as the point above

## [0.1.0](https://github.com/pusher/chatkit-android/compare/919c62d03e...0.1.0) - 2018-01-26

### Changed

- Bump PusherPlatform dependency to 0.3.0
- `addMessage` on `CurrentUser` has been replaced by `sendMessage`

### Added

- Support for message attachments
- `sendMessage` on `CurrentUser`, which replaces `addMessage`; usage looks like this:

```java
currentUser.sendMessage(
    myRoom.getId(),
    "Hey there",
    new MessageSentListener() {
        @Override
        public void onMessage(int messageId) {

        }
    }, new ErrorListener() {
        @Override
        public void onError(Error error) {

        }
    }
);
```

Note that the room's ID is now required as a parameter, not the whole `Room` object as was the case with `addMessage`

- `sendMessage` supports sending messages with an attachment. In the following example we assume that `getAttachmentFile` is a function that returns a `File` object.

```java
File myAttachment = getAttachmentFile();
String chosenFilename = "testing.png";

currentUser.sendMessage(
    myRoom.getId(),
    "Hey there",
    new DataAttachment(myFile, chosenFilename),
    new MessageSentListener() {
        @Override
        public void onMessage(int messageId) {

        }
    }, new ErrorListener() {
        @Override
        public void onError(Error error) {

        }
    }
);
```

There are currently 2 different types of attachment supported:

* `DataAttachment(val file: File, val name: String)`: Use this if you have your file as a `File` and you want it to be stored by the Chatkit servers. The `name` parameter is the name that the file will be given when it is stored by our servers.
* `LinkAttachment(val link: String, val type: String)`: Use this if you have a file stored elsewhere that you would like to attach to a message without it being uploaded to and stored by the Chatkit servers. The `type` `parameter` currently needs to be one of `"image"`, `"video"`, `"audio"`, or `"file"`. This will likely eventually be encoded in an `enum` but for now we're leaving it as just a `String` while we finalise the API.

Here's an example of using a `LinkAttachment`:

```java
currentUser.sendMessage(
    myRoom.getId(),
    "Hey there",
    new LinkAttachment("https://i.giphy.com/PYEGoZXABBMuk.gif", "image"),
    new MessageSentListener() {
        @Override
        public void onMessage(int messageId) {

        }
    }, new ErrorListener() {
        @Override
        public void onError(Error error) {

        }
    }
);
```

- `Message`s now have an optional `attachment` property of type `Attachment?`. `Attachment` looks like this:

```kotlin
data class Attachment(
    var fetchRequired: Boolean = false,
    val link: String,
    val type: String
)
```

If `fetchRequired` is `true` then it means that the attachment is stored on the Chatkit servers and you need to make a request to the Chatkit API to fetch a valid link. To do this you can use the `fetchAttachment` function that has been added to the `CurrentUser` class. You use that like this:

```java
currentUser.fetchAttachment(
    message.getAttachment().getLink(),
    new FetchedAttachmentListener() {
        @Override
        public void onFetch(FetchedAttachment attachment) {

        }
    },
    new ErrorListener() {
        @Override
        public void onError(Error error) {

        }
    }
);
```

You can then use the `attachment.link` to download the file, if you so wish.
